# Matplotlib_challenge

This was a challenge to complete some cleaning and analysis tasks on fictional in-vivo pharmacological data. The analyses include descriptive statistics, 
several kinds of plots, a box plot analysis of some of the therapies, and a linear regression analysis at the end. 

***Files***

Matplotlib_cancer_bio_challenge_final.ipynb - is a Jupyter notebook containing the analysis. It seems to load incorrectly on the first attempt, but display 
correctly if you reload it. If you cannot get this file to work, the code can be perused in the "just_code" version I pushed to this repo (see below).

Matplotlib_challenge_final_just_code_v2.py - this is a de-jupyterized version of the above that I added as a backup. It has the same code as the above Jupyter Notebook
and will execute if the .csv files are placed in the same folder as it. I've seen some errors with the jupyter files not displayling correctly in github. Additionally
I had one instance where moving the file and trying to reupload it to Jupyter caused it to revert to the starter code, and deleted the entire analysis. I believe this occurs because some javascript was added to the file for formatting, which can cause misbehavior. If the Jupyter file above does anything crazy, this file should still work.

Mouse_metadata.csv, and Study_results.csv - these are the data files that were used in the analysis
